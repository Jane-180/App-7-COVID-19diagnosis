Brief Description of Goal of Code:
Assist in detecting symptoms of COVID-19 from cold, flu, or allergies
 
Known Issues:
If you press the back button and select a new answer the code still accounts for the old answer this changing the actual percentage. So no going back to previous questions.
also the calculation for the coughing question for a cold it is common but not neccessarly dry, but I just classified a yes response as +1 anyways
also the fever question was difficult to fully assign points for the cold symptoms because a fever is only short lived
The pie-chart does not depict the correct values that correspond with the calculated values
